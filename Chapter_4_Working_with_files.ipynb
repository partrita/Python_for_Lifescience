    "The `csv.DictReader` class is a powerful and highly recommended tool when you're dealing with CSV files, especially when your data has a clear header row. Instead of giving you lists of strings (where you have to remember index numbers like `row[0]`, `row[1]`), `DictReader` provides each row as a dictionary. This makes your code much more readable and less prone to errors if the column order changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use `DictReader`?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Readability:** Access data by column name (e.g., `row['Name']`) instead of by index (e.g., `row[0]`).\n",
    "* **Maintainability:** Your code is more robust. If a column is reordered in the CSV file, your code won't break as long as the column name remains the same.\n",
    "* **Convenience:** Directly provides data in a key-value pair format, which is often easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Basic Usage of `csv.DictReader`\n",
